# Pandas-Python3.7
This is basic pandas tutorial for Data Analysis.

In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. In pandas we can analyze data in 2 ways. 1) Data Frames 2) Series

Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). 
A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns. Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.

Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index. Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.
Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object supports both integer and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.
